## Structural Integrity Rule

**The numeric folder structure is FIXED and IMMUTABLE.**

Rules:
- The folders under `docs/` follow a strict numeric convention
- **No new numbered folders can be created** without architectural review
- **Parallel folders like `06-ROADMAP` are FORBIDDEN**
- New documents must live within an existing folder
- File naming must use hyphens (`-`), not underscores (`_`)

Approved addition:
- `docs/07-CLIENTES/` is an approved official layer for client-specific documentation.
- It does not replace canonical general documentation.
- It applies canonical rules to a concrete client and must remain consistent with `docs/01-CONSTITUCIONAL/`.

Examples of violations:
```
❌ docs/06-ROADMAP/          (conflicts with 06-FASES)
❌ docs/08-FEATURES/         (no such category exists)
❌ docs/AI_DOCUMENT.md       (underscores not allowed)
```

Correct approach:
```
✅ docs/06-FASES/AI-LISTENER-EVOLUTION-PLAN.md
✅ docs/02-ARQUITECTURA/NEW-DESIGN-PATTERN.md
```

**Rationale:** The numeric taxonomy provides clear navigation and prevents category proliferation. Any new category must justify its existence and integrate into the strategic framework.

---

## Mandatory Rule

Every generated document must:

1. **Explicitly indicate the destination path**
2. **Be saved directly in the corresponding folder**
3. **Include date if it is a report** (YYYY-MM-DD format)
4. **Not create new folders without approval**

---

## Report Naming Convention

```
docs/05-REPORTES/YYYY-MM/REPORT_NAME_YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

**Example:**
```
docs/05-REPORTES/2026-02/DIAGNOSTICO_SCORING_2026-02-21.md
```

---

## Phase Documentation Convention

```
docs/06-FASES/PHASE-N-NAME.md
```

**Example:**
```
docs/06-FASES/PHASE-3-PROSPECT-QUALITY.md
docs/06-FASES/PHASE-4-SESSION-AUTOMATION.md
```

### Required Metadata for Phase / Plan / Status Documents

Every phase, plan, or status-oriented document should declare, when applicable:

- `Status: DRAFT | IN PROGRESS | PARTIALLY COMPLETED | COMPLETED | SUPERSEDED`
- `Last Reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD`
- `Implemented In: branch / PR / commit(s)`

Rules:

- `Status` expresses documentary and implementation maturity, not only author intent
- `Last Reviewed` must be updated whenever the document is materially realigned against code or runtime evidence
- `Implemented In` must reference real implementation evidence when available
- If there is no verified implementation yet, `Implemented In` should be omitted rather than guessed

### Standard Section for Phase / Plan Documents

Phase and plan documents should include this section structure, adapted to their existing style:

```markdown
## Estado de implementación

### Realizado
- ...

### Pendiente
- ...

### Criterio de cierre documental
- ...
```

Normative guidance:

- `Realizado` must describe only verified implementation or verified documentary closure
- `Pendiente` must isolate what still blocks closure or full maturity
- `Criterio de cierre documental` must explain when the document can move to `COMPLETED` or `SUPERSEDED`
- If a document already contains equivalent sections, adapt them instead of duplicating structure mechanically

---

## Constitutional Documents

Location: `docs/01-CONSTITUCIONAL/`

Reserved for:
- PROJECT_STATUS.md (versioned)
- Strategic principles
- Business model definitions
- Decision logs with strategic impact

---

## Architecture Documents

Location: `docs/02-ARQUITECTURA/`

Reserved for:
- System design documents
- Architectural decision records (ADR)
- Module relationships
- Data flow diagrams

---

## Infrastructure Documents

Location: `docs/03-INFRAESTRUCTURA/`

Reserved for:
- Deployment guides
- SSL/TLS configuration
- Server setup
- PM2 process management
- Nginx configuration

---

## Integration Documents

Location: `docs/04-INTEGRACION/`

Reserved for:
- Service integration guides
- External API integrations
- Module communication protocols
- Session Manager integration

---

## Contract Documents

Location: `docs/07-CONTRATOS/`

Reserved for:
- API specifications
- HTTP contracts
- Interface definitions
- SLA agreements (if applicable)

---

## Client-Specific Documents

Location: `docs/07-CLIENTES/`

Purpose:
- Client-specific commercial and operational decisions.
- Application of general LeadMaster rules to each client context.

Required minimum per client folder:
- Operational requirements
- Pricing decision for Prospecto-LeadMaster calificado entregado
- Qualification criteria
- Decision history

Pricing rule reference:
- `docs/07-CLIENTES/CRITERIO-PRICING.md` defines that price per Prospecto-LeadMaster calificado entregado is not based on LeadMaster internal operating cost.
- Pricing is based on client commercial value and client real alternative acquisition/qualification cost.

Current example:
- `docs/07-CLIENTES/HABY/` is the first client-specific documentation folder, with vigente price USD 7.

---

## Archive Policy

Location: `docs/99-ARCHIVO/`

Documents are archived when:
- Superseded by newer versions
- No longer applicable to current architecture
- Historical reference only

**Archive naming:**
```
ORIGINAL_NAME_vX.Y.md
```

**Example:**
```
PROJECT_STATUS_TECHNICAL_v2.md
```

---

## Enforcement

This document defines the **official documentation standard** for LeadMaster Workspace.

Any deviation requires:
1. Explicit justification
2. Entry in DECISION_LOG.md
3. Approval from project lead

Non-compliant documentation may be reorganized or archived without notice.

---
---

## Copilot / AI Compliance Rule

When generating documentation using AI tools (Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.):

- The target folder must be explicitly specified in the prompt.
- The file name must follow the official naming convention.
- The AI must not propose alternative folder structures.

All AI-generated documents are subject to architectural review.

## Documentation Scope Levels

### 1. Workspace-Level Documentation

Location:
```
docs/
```

This directory contains documentation that applies to the entire workspace.

Includes:
- Constitutional framework
- Global architecture
- Infrastructure documentation
- Cross-service integration
- HTTP contracts between services
- Global phase planning
- Governance and decision logs

Rule:
Only documentation that impacts more than one service belongs here.

This directory must NOT contain:
- Service-specific bug reports
- Local diagnostics
- Internal implementation notes
- Temporary operational reports

---

### 2. Service-Level Documentation

Location:
```
services/<service-name>/docs/
```

Each service maintains its own internal documentation.

Includes:
- Diagnostics and debugging reports
- Local implementation notes
- Service-specific architectural details
- Internal refactors
- Module-level guides
- Operational procedures specific to the service

Rule:
If the document affects only one service, it belongs in that service's docs directory.

---

### 3. Anti-Pattern Rule

Markdown files (.md) must NOT be created in service root directories.

Example of incorrect placement:
```
services/central-hub/DIAGNOSTICO_X.md
```

Correct placement:
```
services/central-hub/docs/diagnosticos/DIAGNOSTICO_X.md
```

---

### 4. Governance Principle

The workspace documentation defines the system.
Service documentation defines implementation.

They must never duplicate each other.
They must reference each other instead.
